OVERVIEW 
    • System Preface :- 

The project tends to solve the problem of students lacking in visualizing the Sorting Algorithms by giving them UI based Sorting Visualizer.

    • General Information Of Web App :-

The web app is very helpful for any student or user who finds sorting algorithms difficult to understand. By using this web app the user can see that when the swapping is happening and how the sorting algorithm is working by the help of different colors .User can change the size of the array and also the speed of the algorithms using slider buttons. 
    • System Overview :-
The Project overall aims for the easy understanding of sorting algorithms by the help of simple User Interface .
It is very helpful for user to gain the knowledge of the speed(time taken to sort the whole array) of different sorting algorithms.

.













STEPS FOR SYSTEM FUNCTION 
The functions / workflow of the project is as follows:-

    • Click the URL to open the website - https://sureshk128.github.io/Minor-Project/Visualizer/Sorting%20Visualizer/

    • Click on new array button to generate a new random size array.

    • By the help of size slider button choose size of array as your choice.

    • By the help of slider speed button choose speed of the working of algorithms.

    • Click on any sorting button to start the sorting algorithm.

    • If you want to restart the process then refresh the page.












TECH STACK
As per the discussion with the Development Team, we came to know about the Technologies used. 
These are as follows:-
    • Javascript for working of sorting algorithms,changing the colors and swapping of the array elements .
    • HTML5/CSS/BootStrap/FlexBox for UI

AUTHORIZED USE OF SYSTEM

All the user are free to use the Website. Also the development is open to any contributions from anyone. User can add another sorting algorithms and UI changes in project.


Some Snippets of Project


















Points to be noted:
	- Use Some Algorithms which is already not used in the project.
	- When you start any sorting algorithms then all the buttons and sliders must disabled.
